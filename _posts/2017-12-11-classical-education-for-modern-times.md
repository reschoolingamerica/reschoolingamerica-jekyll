A Classical Education for Modern Times
Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
rectique cultus pectora roborant.1*

An increasing number of independent schools these days, both private and charter—as
well as home-schoolers—are deliberately taking a classical approach to education. By
“classical,” we mean a form of schooling that could be called “back-to- basics” at one end
and a truly liberal education at the other, but in the school reform movement these days
simply goes by the designation “classical.” Some might call it “conservative,” but we
prefer the term “traditional.” That is, we adhere to a centuries-old view of learning and
time-tested teaching methods. Such a choice might at first seem paradoxical or even out-
of-touch with reality. Why, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, in the age of the
internet and iPhone, in a country that has long been addicted to the revolutionary and the
novel, when almost everyone in the world of K-12 education is singing the chorus of
“critical thinking skills for a twenty-first- century global economy,” should reform-
minded schools root themselves so deeply in the past? Is newer not always better? What
could today’s young people learn from old books? The answers to these questions lead
us to a deeper understanding of education—of what our children need most in their
schooling.
Classical education has a history of over 2500 years in the West. It began in ancient
Greece, was adopted wholesale by the Romans, faltered after the fall of Rome, made a
slow but steady recovery during the Middle Ages, and was again brought to perfection in
the Italian Renaissance. The classical inheritance then passed to England, and from the
mother country to America through colonial settlement. At the time of this nation’s
founding classical education was still thriving. Jefferson heartily recommended Greek
and Latin as the languages of study for early adolescence. One of the Founding Fathers’
favorite books was Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans. Eighteenth-
century Americans venerated and trusted George Washington in large part because he
reminded them of the Roman patriot Cincinnatus. So important has classical education
been in the history of the West that it would only be a slight exaggeration to say that the
march of civilization has paralleled the vibrancy of classical schools. Unlike the schools
of earlier centuries, today’s classical schools do not make the ancient languages virtually
the whole of the curriculum (though to be truly classical they must require several years
of Latin study). Still, the modern classical school will remain classical by upholding the
same standards of curriculum, of teaching, and of discipline found in the schools of old.
Indeed, in these schools English will be taught using methods derived from centuries of
teaching and learning the classical languages. This form of schooling takes stock in the
tried and true rather than in the latest fads frothing forth from the schools of education.
Apart from this impressive history, an increasing number of schools and parents are
embracing classical education as the surest road to school reform for at least five reasons.
These reasons constitute a clear break from modern, progressive education and a return to
traditional aims and ways of teaching. Classical education:
* “Yet learning increases inborn worth, and righteous ways make strong the heart.” Horace

 values knowledge for its own sake and for the public good;
 upholds the standards of correctness, logic, beauty, weightiness, and truth intrinsic
to the liberal arts;
 demands moral virtue of its adherents;
 prepares human beings to assume their places as responsible citizens in the
political order;
 cultivates a sense of wonder in children that propels them to want to know more
about and to marvel at their world.
We shall consider each of these pillars of classical education in turn.
Knowledge and Core Knowledge
The classical view of education holds that human beings are thinking creatures.
Unlike other living beings, humans live by their intelligence. We want to know things.
Specifically, we want to know the things around us and how they operate. We want to
know who we are, where we come from, and how we might thrive. Beyond facts, we
want to know what is true and good. Our desire to know begins in childhood. Children
observe everything around them. They pick up language at an astonishing rate. As soon
as they begin to speak, they ask the question “What is it?” of everything that catches their
attention. Children demonstrate what is true of us all: we are all by nature learners. Any
plan of education, therefore, should take advantage of young people’s natural curiosity.
Schemes that stall children in their mastering material of real substance because “they are
not ready for it” or it is deemed not “age appropriate,” or that use various gimmicks that
sugar-coat learning as though children regard their books as they do their medicine, are
not only unnecessary but actually counterproductive and insulting to the human mind.
The young mind constitutes a veritable arsenal of mental capacities: memory, reason,
imagination, a sense of beauty, a facility for language. Yet a classical school does not
just leave children to stew in their own intellectual juices. Rather, it directs and exercises
and strengthens children’s mental capacities in the same way that sports exercise their
physical strength and agility. The mind, like the body, atrophies when not well-trained.
The emphasis on rigorous intellectual training is an essential difference between classical
schooling on the one hand and modern, “student-centered” learning on the other. While
children may be naturally disposed to learning, everything they need to know does not go
to them unaided from nature or spring naturally into their minds. Students need explicit
instruction to understand the world around them, whether in language, the operations of
physical nature, or the achievements of human beings. As children grow, their questions
become increasingly complex and their ability to understand concepts more advanced.
Yet such maturity of mind only warrants further instruction. No orchestra can perform
without a conductor. By stressing childhood “creativity” and “spontaneity,” while at the
same time denigrating “mere rote learning” (and thus human memory itself) and without
making children do much work or work on anything important, the modern school takes
bright young children and puts them on the path to becoming bored adults who do not
know very much. It is the old story of the tortoise and the hare. Falling in love with our

talents—without making any real effort to improve them—causes one to lose the race. In
this case, it is the all-important race towards becoming informed, moral, thinking citizens.
So classical education puts young minds to work. It leads young people to know and
understand themselves and the world around them. Students do not learn in the abstract.
They are unable to engage in so-called “critical thinking” (which used to be called plain
ol’ thinking) without something in particular to think about. Young people must acquire
specific knowledge in specific disciplines to participate fully and effectively in human
conversation. One way to explain this axiom is E. D. Hirsch’s idea of “cultural literacy.”
For people to communicate effectively, according to Hirsch, they must not only use the
same language. To express and understand complex ideas, they must possess a reservoir
of common facts, ideas, and references known to all in a given social and political order.
Abraham Lincoln is perhaps the best example of a leader who relied on cultural literacy
to convey his ideas. Like other Americans on the frontier, he had little formal schooling.
Yet he read intensively the works of Shakespeare, the King James’ Bible, the fables of
Æsop, Euclid’s geometry, and the documents of the American Founding. Few men in
our history have been able to express so forcefully and with such economy the principles
of freedom and human dignity:

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.

Lincoln’s audience at Gettysburg instantly knew that he referred to the “proposition” of
the Declaration of Independence. Lincoln did not have to retell the history of the war or
that great document and the principles it proclaimed. His fellow Americans already knew
that story. Therefore, the Gettysburg Address is not only one of the greatest speeches in
our history; it is the shortest.
Conversely, a modern Lincoln (if one existed) could not count on such knowledge in
his audience. Having been a teacher and professor for the past twenty years, and also
having dipped into the realm of politics, I can avow that most citizens and most elected
officials are alarmingly ignorant of the basic facts of American history and constitutional
government. Young people today do not know either the Declaration or the Constitution
and (when guessing as to their content) often confuse the two. Thus, we have largely lost
the language of liberty. In Hirsch’s terms, “many young people today strikingly lack the
information that writers of American books and newspapers have traditionally taken for
granted among their readers from all generations.” This decline in knowledge affects the
realms of political economy, culture, ethics, and all other facets of American life. Nor is
the business world immune. Employers are constantly amazed at what their employees
do not know and therefore cannot do. Make no mistake. Cultural and civic literacy is not
merely ornamental trivia or a “gifted and talented” program for a handful of students or
an elective major in college. Our purpose is not to make Jeopardy champions or pad a
résumé. Rather, cultural and civic literacy is essential to the flourishing of our nation. A
culturally illiterate America cannot live up to the demands placed upon us by history and
the present condition of the world. A culturally illiterate individual cannot comprehend

and navigate the vast areas of human knowledge essential to his political, financial, and
moral well-being. Jefferson knew that. So did Lincoln.
By embracing the idea of cultural and civic literacy2, classical education invites us to
break out of the cycle of ignorance and incompetence that modern culture and modern
educational practices perpetuate. The students of classical schools study the traditional
liberal arts that the curious, uncorrupted mind longs to know—language and literature,
history and government, mathematics and the sciences, music and art—in a coherent,
logical progression. The classical curriculum advances from the rudiments of literacy,
arithmetic, and storytelling to the higher orders of thought and expression. All students
ought to be immersed in this classical curriculum. Admittedly, different children have
different talents. Some students catch on more quickly than others. We should always
seek to challenge every student all the time. Yet we must regard any system of tracking
that relegates certain students to an inferior curriculum as nefarious. Students do not all
learn at the same speed, but all should be invited to run the course.3
Upholding Standards
In addition to requiring students to know important things, a classical education also
teaches young people judgment according to strict standards. To be “classical” means to
uphold a standard of excellence. The classical works of Greece and Rome are not great
simply because they are old. They are great because they employ harmonious language
to depict remarkable human events, to reveal the heights and depths of human nature, and
to explain the transcendent ideals of human existence. Each of the liberal arts has its own
standard of correctness, logic, beauty, weightiness, and truth. The study of a language
offers perhaps the best example, especially since human beings live by communicating.
Everyone can speak, and most people can read and write at least on a “functional” level.
A classical education requires more than functional literacy, however. It teaches students
from an early age high standards of grammar, precision in word choice, and an eloquence
that can emanate only from a love of the language. Throughout his education, the student
will be exposed to the highest examples of eloquence attained by the greatest writers and
speakers of the language.
“. . . I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.” Shakespeare
“There is a tide in the affairs of men . . .” Shakespeare
“We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.” Shakespeare
“These are the times that try men’s souls.” Paine
“Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”
Churchill
These sentences are entirely grammatical. They could just as easily be used to teach
grammar as “Bob is a big boy.” By preferring Shakespeare to an anonymous “See Bob”

2 I am perhaps taking liberties here by adding “civic” to “cultural literacy,” but in part I am following the
direction of Hirsch’s own thought as seen in his book The Making of Americans.
3 The possible exceptions, to be decided on a case-by- case basis, are students with substantial learning
disabilities. Yet 98% of students should flourish in a classical school, especially when they begin young.

sentence (usually not well written) we teach three things rather than just one. We teach
grammar. We teach cultural literacy. We also teach beauty. Our purpose is to introduce
young people to the masters of the language so they themselves learn to employ force and
beauty in their deployment of the spoken and written word.
Young people today are particularly in need of high standards of thought and beauty.
Their speech ranges from the sloppy to the vulgar. The person whose only expressions of
approval and disapproval are “that’s cool” and “that sucks”—who cannot make it through
a sentence without using the word “like” half a dozen times—lacks not only a copious
vocabulary but also the capacity to judge events according to their nature and gravity.
Music is another area in which students are in dire need of higher standards. The logical
thinking that comes from mathematics and the sciences is no less important. Teachers in
a classical school do not fail to impart to students the standards of taste and reason that
lift them out of the formless dross of the culture. Upholding standards is a principle of
exclusion as much as of inclusion. A classical school does not pretend that all writing is
equally good, that all human endeavors are equally important or beneficial to human life,
or that all scientific theories are equally plausible. In choosing the elements of a classical
curriculum—works of literature and art, events in history, and so on—our motto is that of
Winston Churchill: “I shall be satisfied with the very best.”
Moral Virtue
Education is a moral enterprise. Young people must make good moral decisions daily.
The older they get, the more important the decisions are. “Should I tell Mom that I broke
her favorite vase or pretend like nothing happened?” “Should I copy the answers of the
person sitting next to me?” “Should I smoke the substance and drink the beer my friend
just gave me?” “Should my boyfriend and I have sex since we love each other?” These
are the timeless moral questions youth face today and have always faced. Anyone who
thinks they are new should read the Confessions of St. Augustine. This patriarch of the
church stole pears as a child and as a youth had an illegitimate child. His knowledge of
sin came from his own inner struggle. Schools can approach the moral lives of children
and youth in four ways. They can try to ignore moral issues altogether. They can open
up moral questions for students to explore in a “non-judgmental” and noncommittal way.
They can, through ideology or incompetence or both, undermine time-honored standards
of right and wrong. Or schools can teach traditional manners and self-government.
The first approach simply invites failure. All schools must maintain an atmosphere of
order and decorum for learning to take place. Schools that are laissez-faire in shaping the
character of their students end up with major discipline problems and permit unseemly,
untoward behavior without claiming to do so. The second approach might seem the most
sensible for reasonable people. “Let us talk about morality in a non-judgmental way and
let students come up with their own answers,” say the advocates of moral reasoning and
values clarification. They even make moral discussion a part of the curriculum. What
happens in these discussions is that teachers open up pre-marital sex, drug use, and other
illicit activities as plausible “life choices” so long as students can explain those choices in
terms of “their own values.” Predictably, research has proven that young people who are

exposed to open-ended discussions of moral issues are far more likely to engage in vice.4
Usually in combination with “values clarification,” schools can also either advocate or
talk too much about (“make students aware of”) types of behavior that are both physically
and emotionally destructive. Lacking all sense, many school districts and even states ask
questions about drug use in a way that signals it is perfectly normal to be a pot-smoking,
coke-snorting, crack-head wastrel.
In contrast to these three morally bankrupt approaches, classical schools unashamedly
teach young people the time-tested virtues of human civilization. We embrace Aristotle’s
dictum that one becomes virtuous by practicing the virtues. We believe that every young
person has a conscience. It may be a conscience embattled against the individual’s own
passions and the allurements of the culture, but it is a conscience nonetheless. Like the
capacities of the mind, the conscience must be educated or it will lapse into lethargy. We
insist that students, from the earliest age, always be attentive and polite. We require them
to practice courtesy in their dealings with both adults and each other. We teach them to
exercise self-government. Throughout their studies, they become intimately acquainted
with the great stories of courage and self-sacrifice found in literature and history. These
narratives reveal how actions have consequences and the clear differences between right
and wrong. Just as we encourage students to emulate the intellectual virtues of writers
and scientists, so we invite and inspire them to emulate the moral virtues of heroes and
heroines. When students become capable of discussing virtue in more abstract terms, we
do not present them with moral conundrums seemingly without right or wrong answers.
Instead, we explain to them how striving for right and good leads to happiness in both the
individual and for an entire people. As such, the history of classical education is in large
part a history of the conjunction of learning and virtue. The Roman teacher Quintilian
made the connection explicit:
My aim, then, is the education of the perfect orator. The first essential for such a
one is that he should be a good man, and consequently we demand of him not
merely the possession of exceptional gifts of speech, but all the excellences of
character as well.
Any classical school worth its salt expects no less of its students.
Civics and Citizenship
Classical education has always been concerned with the political order. Aristotle
defined man as “by nature an animal intended to live in a polis.” Accordingly, for the
Greeks education was essentially political. All free citizens bore the responsibility and
the privilege of voting in the assembly and defending the polis from invasion. Young
boys were taught from an early age how to speak and how to fight. The American
Founders similarly hoped that schools would teach young people how to preserve the
constitutional republic they would inherit. The Founders knew that free government
depends not on the decisions of a few politicians but on the wisdom and virtue of a
people. Political wisdom and virtue do not come easily. More than two centuries of
4 See William Kilpatrick, Why Johnny Can’t Tell Right from Wrong, ch. 4.

American history have confirmed that this nation can be sustained only by citizens who
understand, serve, and defend America’s founding principles. As much as the Founders
hoped for a free people living under the rule of law, they feared the unchecked passions
of an uninstructed multitude. In this light, we must regard the decline in civic knowledge
in our day as portending untold danger to the safety and happiness of our people.
True classical schools provide a political education reaffirming our nation’s founding
principles. They exalt the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
as guaranteed by and realized through the American frame of government. They ensure
that their students enter the world as citizens fully aware of both their rights and duties.
They teach students that true freedom and happiness are to be obtained through limited,
balanced, federal, and accountable government that protects the rights and liberties of a
vibrant, enterprising people. Such political knowledge can only be gained by a thorough
study of American history and government. That study must consist largely in reading
primary sources: the words of the Founders themselves. If such explicit civic instruction
appears to some as too patriotic, we must remember that James Madison, the father of our
Constitution, considered a “reverence for the laws” a “prejudice” which even the most
enlightened nations cannot afford to be without.
As young people increase in knowledge, they should likewise increase in wonder.5
The curiosity which propels young children to ask the question, “what is it?”; the innate
sense of beauty that induces admiration; the love of the good that causes them to applaud
the victories of heroes and loathe the actions of villains; and the reverence and awe they
show for the marvels of the physical universe: all constitute what we might call wonder
in the human imagination. It is a sad mark of our times that increased “education” (in the
form of advanced degrees from colleges that used to pursue veritas, lumine, and other
such old, outworn ideals) leads to a detached, snarky, pseudo-sophistication motivated by
a worship of irony and iconoclasm. Rather than characterizing himself as a dwarf sitting
on the shoulders of giants (Newton’s phrase), the modern intellectual scoffs at the flaws
and peccadillos of the heroes and thinkers and artists of the past—no matter the height of
their achievement or extent of their bravery—while vaunting his own dubious scholarship
as “original.” This pseudo-intellectual impertinence is passed on to teachers who pass it
on to their students who are conditioned to consider the study of history as spotting the
specks in the eyes of our forefathers while missing the moats in their own, who casually
dismiss every path-breaking discovery or creation as bound to happen rather than as the
gift of genius and the reward of hard work.
A truly liberal education liberates the mind and soul from the pessimistic relativism
masked as sophistication that is the fatal disease of all peoples in decline. A truly liberal
education preserves the joy of discovery, the innate admiration of the good, and the awe
of beauty that move both mind and heart to a spirit of wonder. Classical, liberal learning
never casts childish innocence aside. A real reading of Jane Austen leads to a tear in the
eye and a swelling of the heart, not to a barrage of counterfeit –isms. A careful study of
the life of George Washington cannot but result in a filial gratitude and admiration for the

Hillsdale College, on this subject.

indispensable father of our country. A similar study of Benjamin Franklin may lead to a
humbling disbelief that any one man could have done and discovered so much. Any play
or poem of Shakespeare is a lesson on the power and beauty of our language.
These—and many others—are the men and women who must become our teachers. We
must wonder at their works. For they show us what is possible in human life.
The End in View
Contrary to popular opinion, classical education is far from arcane, irrelevant, dull,
and unimaginative. Rather, the classical view understands that a human being without
knowledge of the world, without an understanding of civilization, and without a judgment
formed by the standards of true greatness, is much like a man with amnesia. He does not
know who he is or where he comes from. He does not know his rights or his duties. He
knows neither his debts nor his debtors. Worse, he may easily become the pawn of the
first huckster he runs into, so unfamiliar and strange will his surroundings seem to him.
A true classical, liberal, civic education recognizes with Lincoln that if we know where
we are, by knowing where we have been, we shall then know “whither we are tending.”
While parents worry that today’s educational practices shortchange young people by
failing to provide them with the cultural, moral, and civic knowledge necessary to live
both productive and happy lives, they should see great opportunity in the resurgence of
classical schools. Indeed, the growing demand for traditional education on the part of
students and parents alike promises to be the surest means of reacquainting our age with
the fundamentals all educated people used to know: the elegance and order of language,
life-ennobling stories, the all-but- forgotten fine arts, the logic of numerical relations, the
order of the physical world, and the great story of mankind’s quest for justice and for
freedom. Another way of saying this is that an increasing number of Americans today,
even the young, demonstrate a longing for learning things that are good and beautiful and
true. This longing is the first step on the long road of reconstituting our schools—and of
pursuing true happiness.
